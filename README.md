# Test Automation IFRS
Personal project created from scratch for BDD and Test automation trainning with Capybara, Ruby, Selenium Webdriver and Siteprism.

For practicing, on the master branch there is the basic structure for creating an automation project from scratch.

Also, in the challenge branch there are some exercises for practicing automation with Capybara and Ruby.

Have fun! :-)

# Running
For running the project you must go inside the root (where cucumber.yaml is) and type **"cucumber"** on the terminal. This way it will run all tests inside the project with the default configuration.

If you want to run a specific test or change the profiles inside cucumber, you can do it by using tags: 
```
cucumber -p <profile> -t@<test_tag>
```
